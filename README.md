# NGINX-based Media Streaming Server

## nginx-rtmp-module (dash enhanced version)

Forked from https://github.com/sergey-dryabzhinsky/ which was the most up to date version (until now)

Notable new features :

 - add the possibility to make adaptative streaming (show below configuration, using ffmpeg to trancode in 3 variants, and produce one manifest).
   note the "max" flag which indicate which representation should have max witdh and height and so use it to create the variant manifest.
   you can also use any encoder to directly push the variant.
 - add the support of using repetition in manifest to shorten them (option dash_repetition) (thanks to Streamroot)
 - add the support of common-encryption; currently working DRM are ClearKey/Widevine/Playready (see specific doc [here](DRM.md))
 - add the support of ad insertion break event, from rtmp AMF message to dash (InbandEvent in manifest and emsg box in mp4 fragment, see doc [here](DAI.md))


See original doc here for full list of options.
